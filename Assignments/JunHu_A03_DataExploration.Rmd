## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the lessons in Environmental Data Analytics on Data Exploration.

## Directions

1.  Rename this file `<FirstLast>_A03_DataExploration.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2.  Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3.  Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction. 
4.  Assign a useful **name to each code chunk** and include ample **comments** with your code.
5.  Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
6.  When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.
7.  After Knitting, submit the completed exercise (PDF file) to the dropbox in Sakai.

**TIP**: If your code extends past the page when knit, tidy your code by manually inserting line breaks.

**TIP**: If your code fails to knit, check that no `install.packages()` or `View()` commands exist in your code.

## Set up your R session

1.  Check your working directory, load necessary packages (tidyverse, lubridate), and upload two datasets: the ECOTOX neonicotinoid dataset (ECOTOX_Neonicotinoids_Insects_raw.csv) and the Niwot Ridge NEON dataset for litter and woody debris (NEON_NIWO_Litter_massdata_2018-08_raw.csv). Name these datasets "Neonics" and "Litter", respectively. Be sure to include the subcommand to read strings in as factors.

```{r,  message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
Neonics <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/ECOTOX_Neonicotinoids_Insects_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
Litter <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/NEON_NIWO_Litter_massdata_2018-08_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

## Learn about your system

2.  The neonicotinoid dataset was collected from the Environmental Protection Agency's ECOTOX Knowledgebase, a database for ecotoxicology research. Neonicotinoids are a class of insecticides used widely in agriculture. The dataset that has been pulled includes all studies published on insects. Why might we be interested in the ecotoxicology of neonicotinoids on insects? Feel free to do a brief internet search if you feel you need more background information.

> Answer: To understand the ecotoxicology of neonicotinoids on insects, it will help us to assess how effective this inseticide will be when applying to agricultural soils. Also, we could know dose of this insecticide needed to kill insects. 

3.  The Niwot Ridge litter and woody debris dataset was collected from the National Ecological Observatory Network, which collectively includes 81 aquatic and terrestrial sites across 20 ecoclimatic domains. 32 of these sites sample forest litter and woody debris, and we will focus on the Niwot Ridge long-term ecological research (LTER) station in Colorado. Why might we be interested in studying litter and woody debris that falls to the ground in forests? Feel free to do a brief internet search if you feel you need more background information.

> Answer: Litter and woody deris are important to forest ecosystems because they provide essential nutrients to soils and play roles in nutrient cycling.

4.  How is litter and woody debris sampled as part of the NEON network? Read the NEON_Litterfall_UserGuide.pdf document to learn more. List three pieces of salient information about the sampling methods here:

> Answer: 
 1. Litter and fine woody debris are collected from elevated and ground traps, respectively; 2) Litter and fine woody debris sampling is executed at terrestrial NEON sites that contain woody vegetation >2m tall; 3) Ground traps are sampled once per year. Target sampling frequency for elevated traps varies by vegetation on present at the site, with frequent sampling (1x every 2weeks) in deciduous forest sites during senescence, and infrequent year-round sampling (1x every 1-2 months) at evergreen sites.

## Obtain basic summaries of your data (Neonics)

5.  What are the dimensions of the dataset?

```{r}
nrow(Neonics)
ncol(Neonics)
dim(Neonics)
length(Neonics)
```

6.  Using the `summary` function on the "Effect" column, determine the most common effects that are studied. Why might these effects specifically be of interest?

```{r}
summary(Neonics$Effect)
```

> Answer: The most common effect is Population. The studies on effects may help us understand the mechanism and the exposure risk of this insectide.


7.  Using the `summary` function, determine the six most commonly studied species in the dataset (common name). What do these species have in common, and why might they be of interest over other insects? Feel free to do a brief internet search for more information if needed.[TIP: The `sort()` command can sort the output of the summary command...]

```{r}
sort(summary(Neonics$Species.Common.Name))
```

> Answer: They most six commonly studied species are honey bee, parasitic wasp, buff tailed bumblebee, Carniolan honey bee, bumble bee, and Italian Bee. They are all bees. They are of insters over other insects probably because bees were found most sensitive to this insecticide.

8.  Concentrations are always a numeric value. What is the class of `Conc.1..Author.` column in the dataset, and why is it not numeric?

```{r}
class(Neonics$Conc.1..Author.)
```

> Answer:It is factor because we import string as factor when imprting the data

## Explore your data graphically (Neonics)

9.  Using `geom_freqpoly`, generate a plot of the number of studies conducted by publication year.

```{r}
ggplot(Neonics) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = Publication.Year),bins = 20)
```

10. Reproduce the same graph but now add a color aesthetic so that different Test.Location are displayed as different colors.

```{r}
ggplot(Neonics, aes(Publication.Year, colour = Test.Location)) +
  geom_freqpoly(bins = 20)
```

Interpret this graph. What are the most common test locations, and do they differ over time?

> Answer: Lab is the most common test locations. They differ over time as before 2000 the most common site was field natural.

11. Create a bar graph of Endpoint counts. What are the two most common end points, and how are they defined? Consult the ECOTOX_CodeAppendix for more information. 

[**TIP**: Add `theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))` to the end of your plot command to rotate and align the X-axis labels...]

```{r}
ggplot(Neonics, aes(x = Endpoint)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

> Answer:LOEL and NOEL; LOEL (Lowest Observed Effect Level) is the lowest dosage level at which chronic exposure to the substance shows adverse effects on tested animals; The NOEL (no observable effect level) is the highest dose or exposure level of a substance or material that produces no noticeable (observable) toxic effect on tested animals.

## Explore your data (Litter)

12. Determine the class of collectDate. Is it a date? If not, change to a date and confirm the new class of the variable. Using the `unique` function, determine which dates litter was sampled in August 2018.

```{r}
class(Litter$collectDate)
Litter$collectDate <- as.Date(Litter$collectDate, format = "%Y-%m-%d") 
unique(Litter$collectDate)
```


13. Using the `unique` function, determine how many plots were sampled at Niwot Ridge. How is the information obtained from `unique` different from that obtained from `summary`?

```{r}
unique(Litter$plotID)
```

> Answer: 12 plots were sampled at Niwot Ridge.The unique function in R is used to eliminate or delete the duplicate values or the rows present in the vector, data frame, or matrix. Thus, dataframe with same value in one column will be only counted once, while the summary function will also count duplicated values. 

14. Create a bar graph of functionalGroup counts. This shows you what type of litter is collected at the Niwot Ridge sites. Notice that litter types are fairly equally distributed across the Niwot Ridge sites.

```{r}
ggplot(Litter) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = functionalGroup))
```

15. Using `geom_boxplot` and `geom_violin`, create a boxplot and a violin plot of dryMass by functionalGroup.

```{r}
ggplot(Litter) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = functionalGroup, y=dryMass))

ggplot(Litter) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = functionalGroup, y = dryMass)) 
              
```

Why is the boxplot a more effective visualization option than the violin plot in this case?

> Answer: This may be because the size of the dataset is small, and we cannot predict the density from violin plot

What type(s) of litter tend to have the highest biomass at these sites?

> Answer: Needles is the highest biomass at these sites
